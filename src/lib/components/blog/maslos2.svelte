    <h1 class="font-bold">Self-Actualisation Needs</h1>
    <p>
      Self-actualisation refers to the desire for personal growth,
      self-fulfilment, and realising one's full potential. Yes, it is pretty
      poorly defined, I think of it as eudaimonia.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="el el4">
    <h1 class="font-bold">Esteem Needs</h1>
    <p>
      This category involves the need for self-respect, self-esteem, and the
      esteem of others, including recognition, status, and prestige.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="el el3">
    <h1 class="font-bold">Love and Belonging Needs</h1>
    <p>
      These include the desire for interpersonal relationships, friendship,
      intimacy, and a sense of connection with others.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="el el2">
    <h1 class="font-bold">Safety Needs:</h1>
    <p>
      This level involves the need for personal security, stability, and
      protection from harm. In essence the basic needs of a human being to live
      in a society beyond the necessities of survival (job, security (no one
      trying to kill you))
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="el">
    <h1 class="font-bold">Physiological needs</h1>
    <p>
      These include the most basic requirements for survival, such as food,
      water, sleep, and shelter. He originally includes reproduction in here but
      that is slightly contentious and can be debated whether it belongs to a
      higher level.
